Hi. This ensemble is an adaption of some other work from internet. Most of it I did when I was studying Reaktor in Kadenze.

First part, it's the [formant filter from this ensemble in ADSR Tutorials](https://www.adsrsounds.com/reaktor-tutorials/advanced-formant-filter-in-reaktor-part-ii/). When I found this ensemble, I thought that it would be pretty cool having an sequencer to control the changes between vowels. As I was learning about sequencers in Kadenze course, I added it here.

I like the results, and even used an earlier version of this ensemble in a song of my band - [Uruborus](https://soundcloud.com/stoyca/uroborus).

Any criticism or suggestions, you can drop me an e-mail (or open a ticket here on github).
